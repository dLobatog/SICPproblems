; Let f and g be two one-argument functions. The
; composition f after g is defined to be the function x â†’ f (g (x )).
; Define a procedure compose that implements composition. For ex-
; ample, if inc is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument,
; ((compose square inc) 6) -> 49

(define (compose f g)
 (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

; Breaking down the solution, 6 + 1 = 7, 7 squared = 49
