; A directed line segment in the plane can be
; represented as a pair of vectorsâ€”the vector running from the
; origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running
; from the origin to the end-point of the segment. Use your vector
; representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation
; for segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors
; start-segment and end-segment .

(load "2.46.ss")

(define (make-segment v1 v2)
  (cons v1 v2))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cdr segment))
