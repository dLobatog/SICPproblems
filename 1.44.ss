; The idea of smoothing a function is an important
; concept in signal processing. If f is a function and dx is some small
; number, then the smoothed version of f is the function whose
; value at a point x is the average of f (x âˆ’ dx ), f (x ), and f (x + dx ).
; Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that com-
; putes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f .
; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is,
;     smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold
; smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed
; function of any given function using smooth and repeated from 1.43


(define dx 0.00001)
(define (smooth f)
  (lambda (x) (/ (+ (f (- x dx)) (f x) (f (+ x dx)))
                 3)))

; To compute the n-fold smoothed function we need:

(define (compose f g)
 (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (repeated f times)
 (if (= times 1)
  f
  (compose f (repeated f (- times 1)))))
