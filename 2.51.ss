; Define the below operation for painters. Below takes
; two painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame,
; draws with the first painter in the bottom of the frame and with the
; second painter in the top. Define below in two different waysâ€”first
; by writing a procedure that is analogous to the beside procedure
; given above, and again in terms of beside and suitable rotation
; operations
