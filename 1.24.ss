;Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of
;Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test
;each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat
;test has Î˜(log n ) growth, how would you expect the time to test
;primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test
;primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain
;any discrepancy you find?
