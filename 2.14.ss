; After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished sys-
; tem. Several years later, after she has forgotten all about it, she gets
; a frenzied call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit. It seems that Lem
; has noticed that the formula for parallel resistors can be written in
; two algebraically equivalent ways:
; R1 * R2
; -------
; R1 + R2
;
; and
; 1
; -------------
; 1/R1 + 1/R2
;
; He has written the following two programs, each of which com-
; putes the parallel-resistors formula differently:
(define (par1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
                (add-interval r1 r2)))

(define (par2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval
      one (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
                        (div-interval one r2)))))

; Lem complains that Alyssaâ€™s program gives different answers for
; the two ways of computing. This is a serious complaint.

; Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the be-
; havior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions. Make
; some intervals A and B , and use them in computing the expres-
; sions A/A and A/B . You will get the most insight by using intervals
; whose width is a small percentage of the center value. Examine the
; results of the computation in center-percent form

(define a (make-center-percent 30 0.01))
(define b (make-center-percent 10 0.01))

; The main reason why this is happening is because these divisions are
; taking floating point precision to its limit, so if divisions are
; performed more than once, the error is propagated further away.
;
; For instance, operations like (center (div-interval a a)) are just an approximation
; to 1. This should be taken into account when operating with this interval
; library.
